# 🎥 Video Transcription & Metadata Annotation System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Video Intelligence system that processes recorded video calls and produces:
- Timestamped speech transcription
- Emotion analysis from audio
- Delivery nuance analysis (tone, pace, confidence)
- Reaction annotations per transcript segment
- A concise conversation summary

The system is built using Python, Streamlit, and pretrained speech models, and is designed to demonstrate multimodal AI processing of video data.

## 🧩 Components Breakdown

### 1. Transcription Module
- Converts extracted audio into timestamped text segments
- Uses pretrained SpeechBrain ASR models

### 2. Emotion Annotation
- Detects emotions from speech audio
- Outputs probability-based emotion labels

### 3. Delivery Nuances
- Analyzes speech pace, pauses, and tone
- Helps understand how something was said, not just what

### 4. Reaction Annotation
- Assigns conversational reactions per transcript segment
- Examples: agreement, hesitation, confidence, uncertainty

### 5. Summarization
- Generates a concise summary of the conversation
- Based on the full transcript text

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd video-transcription-metadata-annotation


2. Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Application
streamlit run app.py

🚀 Usage Guidelines

Launch the Streamlit app

Upload a video file (.mp4, .mov, .avi)

The system will:

Extract audio

Generate timestamped transcript

Annotate emotions, delivery, and reactions

Produce a summary

Final output is saved as:
outputs/final_output.json
